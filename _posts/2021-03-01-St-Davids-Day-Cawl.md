For anyone looking for a good cawl (welsh lamb and vegetable stew) recipe here's the one my mother taught me, you can't beat home cooking! 

### Ingredients

  * Lamb Shoulder (ask the butcher for amount for the number of servings but about 300g per person)
  * With vegetables, use the ratio of 1-2 of each for about 4 servings, and scale for preference (I like more carrot/parsnip and less potato)
    * Carrot
    * Swede
    * Potato
    * Parsip
    * Onion
    * Turnip
    * Leek
  * 1 Bouquet Garni


### Method

 * Place lamb into slow cooker/large stock pot and fill with water to cover.
 * Allow to cook for 4-5 hours on a low setting/heat. 
 * Leave to cool, and skim off fat from the top of the water. 
 * Remove the meat and cut into 2cm chunks, place in a bowl in the fridge. 
 * Using the same water that you just cooked the meat in, add the vegetables (cut into 2cm chunks) and the bouquet garni. Cook overnight or as long as possible. 
 * Before serving, add a portion of lamb to each serving dish then top with the broth. 
 * Best served with crusty bread. 

 Enjoy!
