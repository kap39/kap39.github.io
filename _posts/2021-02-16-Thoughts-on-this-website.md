This is a collection of thoughts I had whilst editing this website. 

My website is forked from [academicpages](https://academicpages.github.io). I had a previous website taken from a w3 template that ran exclusively in html and figured it was time for a refresher. Plus editing from home became a hassle when my website was hosted on the universities server, so I decided to try out github pages, since I could edit it much easier on my home machine. Therein, however, lies the problem. I have no experience with ruby, jekyll, or to some extent markdown, which are what this template is created in. Even writing this blog post in markdown I'm having to constantly learn the language on the fly! 

You might ask why I've given myself such a monumental task, however I figured it was an excellent learning opportunity, plus a chance to have a really sleek, stylish website that perfectly expresses who I am as a mathematician and educator. The blog section on the website came included in the template is also an opportunity for me to allow myself to be heard. I struggle with putting my thoughts out for public consumption and shy away from opportunities to give talks and share my research, so why not write about it on my website instead? But first things first, I need to figure out how to create the website. 

The teaching section was relatively easy, since it came pre-packaged. All I needed to do was change the words in the markdown of each section. The Research section however is taking more work. I think I need to create a `_research` folder, as well as a `research` html or markdown in the `_pages` section. We'll try that and see what happens...

Okay we have the research page published. That was a lot easier than I was expecting. However it turns out there is a `_research` file already created in the files, which have `portfolio` documents in them. I'm not quite sure what to make of them so I'll leave them alone for now. Now I just have to figure out what to put on the research page versus what should be on the home page. From looking at other academic websites, there's a large focus on publications, however as I'm less than a year into my PhD I don't really have any of those yet, so it's better to have that as a section under research for the time being. Then there's biography, CV, talks, conferences/attended stuff, and contact that I think all need to be divided between the home page and the research page...

All in all, I'm just going to keep figuring it out as I go along, but so far it's not looking too bad!
