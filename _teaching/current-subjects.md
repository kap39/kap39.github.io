This section contains structural information about the running of my current modules. There are also condensed notes meant to supplement the running of the courses.  


# MA10230: Multivariable Calculus and Differential Equations

This is the section for the semester 1 module, MA10230, for the academic year 21/22. The notes provided below are in no means a replacement for lecture notes and only meant to supplement the learning for students already enrolled in this course at the University of Bath. _The notes provided on this page are provided exclusively for educational purposes at the University of Bath to supplement the module MA10230, and are to be used for private study only. They are not for resale._

## Deadlines and Tutorial information

Please submit your homework to the correct pigeonhole by no later than Tuesday at 5pm. Tutorials will be held weekly in person in the later half of the week. Please email me if you are going to miss a tutorial or can't make this homework deadline if you require an extension.

## Week 1 - Integrals, Lengths and Areas
For a function \$ y=f(x) \$ defined over an interval \$[a,b]\$
* Arc length \$ S(a,b) = \int_a^b \sqrt{1+\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^2}dx \$
* Surface Area of Revolution \$ A(z,b) = \int_a^b 2\pi y\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^2} dx \$
* Sketches and Classic Shapes. When you're going to sketch a graph you need to keep track of a few behaviours of the graph
    * What happens to the graph at \$ \pm \infty\$ . 
    * Are there any asymptotes? 
    * What is the behaviour of the of the gradient? Is it increasing, decreasing?
    * Where are the max/min stationary points?
    * Where does it cross the axes?

2. State the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. 
3. What is the relation between \$ \int_a^b f(x) dx \$ and \$ \int_b^a f(x) dx\$. 
4. For a continuous function \$ f(x)\$ over an interval \$[a,b]\$
