# A level Notes

The PDFs attached below are a notes I made and used in 2012/13 when sitting my own mathematics and further mathematics A level exams (WJEC Board). They have not been updated to sit within the current curriculum however are separated by topic so are still relevant. They assume some precursory knowledge of the subjects and are simply revision notes, rather than teaching materials.
