My research lies in the boundary between theoretical and computational fluid dynamics, using numerical methods to validate the theoretical assumptions around the presence of a lubricating air layer that is present beneath bouncing droplets. Motivated by work done on hydrodynamic pilot-wave theory, I'm considering millimetric droplets rebounding on a liquid bath, at speeds where  surface tension of the free surface is present.

 I'm supervised by [Prof. Paul Milewski](https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/persons/paul-milewski/) (50%), [Dr Jonathan Evans](https://people.bath.ac.uk/masjde) (25%) and [Dr. Phil Trinh](https://http://www.ptrinh.com/) (25%).
