## Outreach 
![RI Masterclass '22](/images/Me/RITalk.jpeg){: width="45%" style="float:left; padding-right:10px" }

<br />
&nbsp;First trained as a <a href="https://www.stem.org.uk/stem-ambassadors">STEM Ambassador</a> in 2017, I have been taking part in outreach events since my undergraduate days, supporting festivals, leading workshops in schools, and more recently presenting to larger audiences. Events I've supported include <a href="https://museum.wales/cardiff/whatson/10492/Brain-Games/">Brain Games 2017</a>, <a href="https://mathsinspiration.com/">Maths Inspiration 2019</a>. In Spring 2022 I gave my first Royal Institution Maths Masterclass (shown on the right) alongside my fellow PhD students at the University of Bath. As of Autumn 2023 I'm delighted to be a rostered speaker for <a hdref="https://educationinaction.org.uk/">Education in Action</a> and have spoken at their Physics in Action days, which consisted of speaking infront of hundres of A level Physics students.

&nbsp; I created  the <a href="https://behindtheresearch.github.io">Behind the Research</a> project nad successfully lead it during my final years at the Unversity of Bath. This initiative is a group of PhD students trying to showcase the real day to day life of academic research, through livestreams, videos and social media we hope to de-mystify maths at the PhD level and show the variety of life that research can give. 
<br />

&nbsp; I also helped create, and now lead <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/phd-your-way">PhD Your Way</a>, an annual  online event for final year undergraduates, and masters students, focused on informing them of the variety of maths PhD opportunities in the UK. This event was  co-founded by <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/patricknairne/">Patrick Nairne</a>, and a collaboration of academics from multiple different universities. Our first event hosted 15 universities, and our second successfully ran with 23 different universities in atttendance. 
<br />

&nbsp;I have a series of talks available ranging from Number Theory to Fluid Dynamics, 'the maths of music' and more. Talks can be catered to a variety of audiences including school children, adults, online and live events. Please get in contact using the email above if you would like to discuss a presenting role.

## Streaming

In May 2021, I started streaming on Twitch, and as such my channel <a href="https://twitch.tv/KatDoesMaths">KatDoesMaths</a> was born. Twitch is a platform that allows people to livestream to a public audience with an interactive chat function. Typically the platform is used for streaming games, but more and more people are finding ingeneous new ways to utilise the platform. As such there is an ever growing community of Science Communicators on the platform. Personally I use the platform to showcase my life as a PhD student, practise my outreach talks and get people passionate about mathematics. It is content that is unedited, authentic and allows a question and answer style interaction between myself and the audience. 

I currently aim to stream at least three times a week, but would love to be able to increase that number. At the minute I have three main types of streams: 
<ul>
    <li> Pomodoro Co-working Streams - these are some of my favourite (not just because they're the most productive). During these streams I will usually share what I'm working on in the PhD at the minute, allowing people to ask questions and see what the day-to-day life of a PhD student actually looks like. </li>
    <li> Office Hours - These streams I've been using to work on science communication by mixing between going through exam papers, and having outreach talks. Currently wee've been looking at the summer 2019 A Level WJEC syllabus, and have completed all Unit 1-4 past papers on stream. I am currently moving on to a series of streams focused on topics of maths that are based around A level difficulty.  </li>
    <li> Puzzle Games - Okay so these ones are definitely more similar to the typical content on twitch, but I can't say no to the occasional video game so why not make it educational, everybody loves a good puzzle!</li>
</ul>

## Collaborations and places to see my face

I've been fortunate enough to meet some really wonderful people and collaborate with them. Check out this interview I did with Meg over at <a href="https://girlswhostem.wordpress.com">Girls Who STEM</a> for her "Women in STEM Wednesday" series in  Sept '21. In October '21 I spent a few days showing <a href="https://simonpxfphys.com">Dr Simon Clark</a> around to give him an inside of my day-to-day life for his "PhD Stories" series of videos, it was so much fun to film and was great to get him to join me on a stream! I have been invited back to Simon's channel to collaborate again on a mildly controversial video that ranked fluid phenomena! (Turbulence is still not going high on my list!) 

In November '23 I was interviewed by Chalkdust magazine, having a chat about everything I'm up to these days.
