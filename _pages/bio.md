## Biography
I'm a postgraduate student at the University of Bath, studying for my integrated PhD in mathematics with the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Statistical Applied Mathematics (SAMBa). Prior to this, I completed my undergraduate masters degree at Cardiff Univeristy. I have been tutoring first year undergraduate mathematics since 2018 and, I've been doing [private tuition](https://kap39.github.io/teaching/private-tuition) for KS3, GCSE and A level mathematics students since 2019.   

Outside of academia I can be found enjoying various different aerial sports, circus skills and acroyoga. I'm also an avid rugby fan and have been a supporter of my home side The Ospreys since their formation. A fun fact about me: I had my local stadium named after me as part of their 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary celebrations.
