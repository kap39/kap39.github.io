Welcome to the fifth annual SAMBa Summer Conference, taking place 5th to 7th of July. This website will be updated with conference details as they are confirmed. 

The SAMBa conference is an opportunity for students to showcase their work to members of the department, outside the department and at other Universities in a supportive environment. The work of SAMBa students covers the entire spectrum of statistical applied mathematics: including projects in statistics, probability, analysis, numerical analysis, mathematical biology, fluid dynamics, machine learning and high-performance computing. The conference is organized by students and contains talks by SAMBa students, external speakers, and students from other departments and institutions.

>Title: From testing chemicals to foreseeing riots: Why Study Groups with Industry are fun.
>
>Abstract: Study Groups with Industry originated over 50 years ago in UK, which spread all over the world. These week-long workshops are great opportunity for the PhD students to get experience in using mathematical methods for solving real-world problems in collaboration with the industry. During this talk I will promote these workshops by giving audience a taste of variety of research topics that participants can work on. Three mini case studies will cover topics ranging from probability (optimising chemical testing process), through mathematical modelling (estimating conductance of heterogenous materials) to statistics (detecting abnormal behaviour in crowds), so people from all backgrounds may find something interesting.

>Title: Genealogies in a branching random walk with selection
>
>Abstract: The N-particle branching random walk (N-BRW) is a particle system, which can be viewed as a toy model of an evolving population affected by natural selection. In the N-BRW at each time step, N particles have locations on the real line. Each of the N particles has two offspring, which have a random displacement from the location of their parent according to some fixed jump distribution. Then among the 2N offspring particles, only the N rightmost particles survive to form the next generation. The long term behaviour of the N-BRW heavily depends on the tail of the jump distribution. In this talk I will explain our result about the genealogies of the surviving particles in a late generation, in the case when the jump distribution has polynomial tails.
